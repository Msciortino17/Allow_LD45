# Allow
Ludum dare 2019 submission.

This is a simple puzzle platformer. 
The theme of ludum dare this year was "Start with nothing."
Allow interprets this by having you start with no win conditions, or "goals" as they're called.
You will have to think about which goals to pickup and when in order to complete each level.
Note: Due to time constraints, there is only a tutorial and 2 levels which are fairly small. After the competition, I may add more.
